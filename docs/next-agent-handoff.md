# RustAssetRipper hand-off — 2026-10-10

## Active stage (2026-10-11)

Product Convergence mode is active under the user's current task attachment. Local 用户资源格式/VRCA acceptance is authorized. Frozen AssetRipper source remains the behavioral reference. Unity Editor runtime validation is unavailable in this environment.

## Current acceptance and blocker

- Primary acceptance sample: 青岚雅苑` (Unity 2022.3.22f1). Current Rust export: `target/real-acceptance-20261011-avtr青岚古境-blendtree-serialization-r1`; 8,548 objects, 1,537 asset files, 705 AnimationClips, and 9 AnimatorControllers. Frozen source export: `target/real-acceptance-20261011-avtr青岚古境-source/ExportedProject`.
- The broad YAML inventory still does not scan `.state` or `.blendtree`. Source has 13 standalone `.state` and 41 `.blendtree` assets which Rust embeds in controller documents. The new `tools/compare-controller-blendtrees.ps1` compares every recursive tree graph: 174/174 documents, 156/156 unique semantic graphs, 631/631 child records, zero differences. Report: `target/real-acceptance-20261011-avtr青岚古境-blendtree-graph-r1.json`.
- CURRENT_BLOCKER: the unnamed `AutoDresser_Comp` and `AutoDresser_Decomp` layers' runtime behavior is unverified. Raw typed constants read from input `AnimatorController` object 3272 (PathID `207285344989274544`) account for all 24 Rust transitions: all target selector index 1 (exit), and the decoded conditions match the emitted Local/Bool conditions. Source leaves both machine names blank and skips their child states; its external `.state` assets have empty `m_Transitions`. This explains the source project-output omission, but the raw constants were decoded through the Rust reader and do not independently establish runtime semantics.
- Next action: obtain an independent source-runtime projection of those packed constants or sample the two layers in Unity Editor. Unity Editor dynamic sampling is unavailable in this environment, and UABEA was not used. Keep runtime equivalence and sample acceptance open. Full hashes, raw condition values, and the validation boundary are in `docs/differential-findings.md` and `docs/validation-log.md`.
- `青岚山河卷` (SHA-256 `100338C82E934B51357CE143106DE8EC43C4389DD50727E0674BFD3CC137267A`) exports to 1,087 assets. Its 12 default-YAML lightmaps are class-28 YAML and were byte-identical before and after the false-positive notice fix. Latest replay: `target/real-acceptance-20261011-青岚山河卷-yaml-diagnostics-r2`.

The dated checkpoint below is historical. Its Phase 2 lock is superseded by the current Product Convergence authorization. Preserve the untracked local `cleanup_manifest.txt` and `tools/probes/anim-convert/packages/`.

## Historical checkpoint state

- Repository: C:\Users\koishi\Desktop\RustAssetripper\RustAssetRipper
- Branch: main; starting HEAD: 4bcaba2399eb3e3f72741aebd0c40e6d06ee34aa, matched origin/main before this checkpoint.
- Phase 1 full Rust port remains OPEN. Phase 2 remains LOCKED. Do not open, hash, identify, parse, or export user VRChat bundles, and do not read or run UABEA until the Phase 1 gate passes.
- Reference baseline: local AssetRipper 2.0.0 snapshot, 1,449 files; manifest is docs/baseline-files.sha256 (SHA-256 29d1fd27f66b974c43750f30aa99117eb423cb318f3062daf05e1489f10f08f9).
- Feature ledger: 386 rows, 363 verified and 23 non-verified. This work does not close a broad parity row.

## Latest implementation checkpoint

- The product stream mount path now uses one recursive SmartStream child router for UnityFS, UnityRaw, UnityWeb, and UnityWebData, with SerializedFile and Resource leaves. Source-backed ranges are distinguished from decoded/materialized children for active nested-byte accounting; UnityFS one-layer wrapper and failed-entry semantics are retained. Remaining slice/Cow dispatch belongs to the legacy in-memory APIs. Some bounded entry ranges still need temporary backing when they cannot safely retain a source range.
- Unity 2022.3 AnimatorController work covers source-projected simple and nested 1D BlendTrees, state-machine hierarchy, ordered behaviour/editor collection ownership, and scoped pointers. Broader controller export, other blend modes/version branches, and Unity runtime sampling remain open.
- Generated EditorSettings and conditional project outputs now cover original StreamingAssets copying, catalog-wide auxiliary GameAssemblies, and persisted script/StreamingAssets options. Complete manager dependency closure and remaining import/export settings are still open.
- The latest evidence and exact commands are in docs/validation-log.md; source differences are in docs/differential-findings.md. No expected fixture or frozen baseline was modified.

## Validation at stop

Latest focused runs passed:
- cargo test --lib export:: --locked --quiet: 479 passed, 1 ignored.
- cargo test --lib io::platform_ --locked --quiet: 43 passed.
- cargo test --bin assetripper-rs export_project_ --locked --quiet: 53 passed.
- cargo check --workspace --locked.
- cargo fmt --all -- --check; git diff --check; tools/verify-baseline.ps1 (1,449 files unchanged).
- The managed-project source probe build and post-export mode also passed; its fixture hash and command are recorded in the validation log.

Full workspace tests, full Clippy, and Unity Editor import/runtime checks were not run for the latest increment. Unity runtime is unavailable without a valid Editor license. Do not upgrade focused evidence into a full Phase 1 pass.

## Next work

Continue from docs/phase1-closure-inventory.md. The nearest product gaps are shared-release AnimatorController ownership and remaining assembly processing/dependency closure, followed by the other open resource and project-export paths. Keep Phase 1 as the gate; the smallest 用户资源格式/VRCA acceptance is not authorized until it passes.

## Preserved local scratch

The checkpoint intentionally excludes and leaves untouched: src/bin/ (three local probe programs), tools/compare-real-unity-projects.ps1, and tools/probes/anim-convert/packages/ (22 restored package files). Review these separately before any future staging.
The Unity 5.6 RenderSettings regression in src/main_tests_05.rs and its source fixture are also preserved locally but excluded from this checkpoint, following the earlier limit on adding Unity 5.6-specific synthetic cases.
