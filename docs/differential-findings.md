# Source behavior and differential findings

This log records behavior differences found between the Rust port and the frozen local source. A source-code analysis is identified as such; it is not described as an executed C# differential.

## DIFF-BROTLI-METADATA-001 — metadata length off by one in source detection

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Rust detector corrected and regression-covered; C# execution and Unity-produced-file comparison remain unrun |
| Source location | `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.IO.Files/CompressedFiles/Brotli/BrotliFile.cs`, `BrotliFile.IsBrotliFile` |
| Input evidence | `scheme::tests::dispatches_a_spec_encoded_unity_brotli_metadata_wrapper` constructs a Brotli stream with Unity's 36-byte marker in an empty metadata meta-block, followed by an uncompressed meta-block containing `webdata payload` and a final empty block. The fixture is assembled from RFC 7932 bit fields; the pinned decoder returns the exact payload for every WBITS value from 10 through 24. |
| Source-derived behavior | The source reads the encoded `MSKIPLEN - 1` value and compares it directly with `BrotliSignature.Length`. For the valid 36-byte marker, the encoded value is 35, so the signature comparison fails. This is derived from the inspected implementation; the C# method was not executed because `dotnet` is unavailable. |
| Root cause | RFC 7932 §9.2 stores metadata length minus one. The detector omitted the `+1` needed to obtain the number of metadata bytes before comparing the marker length. |
| Rust change | `has_brotli_file_signature` now parses the Brotli window header, validates the empty metadata block fields and zero alignment bits, adds one to the encoded length, bounds the marker read, and compares the metadata bytes. The recursive scheme reader then decodes the same input under the configured output limit. |
| Regression evidence | The constructed marker streams are recognized and decoded for WBITS 10–24. `docs/validation-log.md` records the full test run. |
| Remaining comparison | No C# execution, separate Brotli encoder run, AssetRipper-produced wrapper, or real-file differential has been performed. |

The format reference is [RFC 7932 §9.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7932.html#section-9.2). Its metadata length field stores `MSKIPLEN - 1`, and the metadata bytes are excluded from decompressed output.
## DIFF-MULTIFILE-SEEK-END-001 — source uses the opposite End offset sign

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Rust follows standard End-relative seek semantics; source discrepancy is identified by static inspection; C# execution is unavailable |
| Source location | AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.IO.Files/Streams/MultiFileStream.cs, MultiFileStream.Seek |
| Input evidence | io::stream::tests::multi_file_stream_reads_across_parts_and_seeks_logically seeks to End(-2) over a seven-byte logical stream and reads the final two bytes. |
| Source-derived behavior | The inspected source sets Position to Length - offset for SeekOrigin.End. With the conventional negative offset used to seek backward from end, this moves beyond the stream length. |
| Rust behavior | MultiFileStream implements Rust Seek semantics: the End-relative offset is added to the logical stream length. |
| Remaining comparison | This is a source-code discrepancy, not an executed C# differential. The local AssetRipper cannot be built here because dotnet is unavailable. |

## DIFF-REFERENCE-TEST-NEWLINE-001 — 20 reference test failures are a checkout artifact, and they confirm LF is the intended YAML newline

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Root cause identified from source plus executed reference test output. Not a product defect and not a Rust defect. |
| Source location | `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.Tests/Traversal/DefaultYamlWalkerTests.cs`; `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.Yaml/YAMLWriter.cs` |
| Input evidence | The reference suite was executed in an isolated copy. `AssetRipper.Tests` reported `Failed: 20, Passed: 151, Total: 171`. Every failure message has the same shape, for example `Expected: "%YAML 1.1\r\n%TAG !u!..."` versus `But was: "%YAML 1.1\n%TAG !u!..."` with `Strings differ at index 9`, which is the first newline. The seven other test projects passed completely: AssemblyDumper 9/9, Assets 57/57, GUI.Web 6/6, IO.Files 137/137, Numerics 65/65, SerializationLogic 54/54, Yaml 11/11. Reference total: 339 passed, 20 failed. |
| Source-derived behavior | `DefaultYamlWalkerTests.GenerateYaml` constructs `StringWriter { NewLine = "\n" }`, so the generated document uses LF. The expected values are C# raw string literals, whose line endings come from the `.cs` file itself. |
| Root cause | The frozen checkout is CRLF. `DefaultYamlWalkerTests.cs` was measured as 354 LF of which 354 are CRLF and 0 are lone LF, so every raw string literal contains `\r\n` while the writer deliberately emits `\n`. A CRLF assertion cannot match an LF writer. |
| Reference build status | `dotnet 10.0.401` is available on this workstation, so `dotnet restore AssetRipper.slnx` and `dotnet build AssetRipper.slnx -c Release` both exit 0 across all 51 projects. The earlier handoff statement that `dotnet` was unavailable no longer holds. |
| Rust behavior | `src/export/unity_yaml.rs` already emits `\n` for the YAML head, node line breaks, and the document separator, which matches the source writer's configured newline and not the CRLF checkout. No Rust change was required. |
| Remaining comparison | This finding documents a test-fixture/checkout mismatch, not a behavior difference. A LF checkout of the same commit would make the 20 assertions pass. Unity Editor import checks and the reference GUI/web runtime remain unrun. |


## DIFF-YAML-DASH-WHITESPACE-001 — `-` followed by non-space Unicode whitespace

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Fixed in Rust and regression-covered by a reference-runtime differential |
| Source location | `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.Yaml/YamlScalarNode.StringNode.cs`, `GetStringStyle` / `IllegalStringsRegex` (`(^-\s)`) |
| Input evidence | Isolated probe (`Temp/opencode/yamlemitprobe`) referencing the built net10.0 `AssetRipper.Yaml.dll`: `YamlScalarNode.Create("-\u00A0foo")` and `"-\u2003foo"` emit `'-\u00A0foo'` and `'-\u2003foo'` (single-quoted), while `"-\u200Bfoo"` stays plain. |
| Source-derived behavior | The regex alternative `(^-\s)` uses .NET `\s` = `[ \f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}]`, so a `-` followed by any whitespace starts a quoted scalar. Control whitespace is already DoubleQuoted earlier, so only non-control Unicode whitespace (for example U+00A0, U+2003) reaches this branch. |
| Root cause | The Rust predicate used `value.starts_with("- ")`, which only recognizes an ASCII space after the dash. |
| Rust change | `string_needs_quotes` now tests `value.starts_with('-')` plus `char::is_whitespace` on the following character. |
| Regression evidence | `unity_yaml::tests::scalar_quoting_matches_the_reference_yaml_runtime` embeds the probe's exact document bytes for `-\u00A0foo`, `-\u2003foo`, and `-\u200Bfoo`. |
| Remaining comparison | Only the probe's 48 cases were executed; a broader value sweep and Unity-produced YAML remain unrun. |

## DIFF-YAML-EMPTY-WHITESPACE-001 — empty plain value drops the pending space

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Fixed in Rust and regression-covered by a reference-runtime differential |
| Source location | `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.Yaml/Emitter.cs`, `Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>)` |
| Input evidence | The same isolated probe wrote `{k: <empty string>}`; the reference runtime emitted `k:\n` (no space after the colon), while the Rust emitter produced `k: \n`. |
| Source-derived behavior | `Emitter.Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>)` calls `WriteDelayed()` only when the span is non-empty. An empty plain scalar therefore lets the newline from `EndTransition` cancel the deferred whitespace instead of flushing it. |
| Root cause | The Rust `write_str` unconditionally called `write_delayed()` before appending, flushing the deferred space. |
| Rust change | `write_str` now returns early for an empty value, matching `Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>)`. |
| Regression evidence | The differential table's first case (`""` -> `k:\n`) plus the empty-string cases in `EXP-YAML-QUOTING-001`. |
| Remaining comparison | The rule is pinned for scalar values; whether an empty mapping/sequence node produces the same cancellation in every layout was not separately probed. |


## DIFF-YAML-FLOAT-FORMAT-001 — float scalars must follow .NET shortest-round-trip formatting

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Fixed in Rust and regression-covered by a reference-runtime differential |
| Source location | `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.Yaml/YamlScalarNode.NumericNode.cs`; `YamlScalarNode.FloatingPointHexNode.cs`; `Emitter.cs` `Write(float)`/`Write(double)`; `AssetRipper/Source/AssetRipper.IO.Files/InvariantStreamWriter.cs` |
| Input evidence | Isolated net10.0 probe (`Temp/opencode/numericprobe/numeric_probe.json`, 203 cases) capturing `Single`/`Double.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` for curated boundaries plus 60+60 deterministic pseudo-random finite bit patterns. |
| Source-derived behavior | Floats pass through `TextWriter.Write` under the baseline's invariant culture, so Unity YAML floats use .NET's default shortest-round-trip "G" format: `NaN` -> `NaN`; `+Inf` -> `Infinity`; `-Inf` -> `-Infinity`; zero keeps its sign (`0`/`-0`). Scientific notation is used when the decimal exponent `e` is below -4 or at least 9 (`Single`) / 17 (`Double`); the exponent is always signed and zero-padded to two digits. `FloatingPointHexNode` wraps the same text as `0x{bits:x8}({value})` / `0x{bits:x16}({value})`. |
| Root cause | Rust emitted `f32`/`f64` through `Display`, which never uses exponent notation and spells infinities `inf`/`-inf`; for example `1E-05` became `0.00001` and `3.4028235E+38` became a 39-digit integer. |
| Rust change | Added `format_dotnet_f32`/`format_dotnet_f64`, which parse Rust's shortest-round-trip `LowerExp` digits and apply the measured notation thresholds; both the plain and hex scalar arms now use them. |
| Regression evidence | `unity_yaml::tests::float_formatting_matches_the_reference_runtime` asserts all 203 captured values; the quoting differential next to it also exercises `\u0000` and control characters. |
| Remaining comparison | The probe covers finite values and the special forms; no Unity-produced YAML float comparison has run, and the earlier `EXP-YAML-NUMERIC-001` row previously relied on Rust formatting. |


## DIFF-NORMALIZE-DIVISION-001 — `Vector3.Normalize` divides instead of using a reciprocal

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Fixed in Rust and regression-covered by a reference-runtime differential |
| Source location | `System.Numerics.Vector3.Normalize` used by `CompressedMeshExtensions.GetNormals`/`GetTangents`/`MakeFloatAndSignArrays` |
| Input evidence | Isolated probe (`Temp/opencode/meshprobe`) called `Vector3.Normalize` on `(1.2, 0.1, 0)`, `(-3, 4, 0)`, and `(1, 1, 1)` and recorded the exact bit patterns; the Rust port using a reciprocal gave `1065295263` for the first component of the first vector where .NET gives `1065295264`. |
| Source-derived behavior | `Vector3.Normalize` computes `value.X / length`, `value.Y / length`, `value.Z / length` — a per-component division, not a `1.0 / length` reciprocal multiply. |
| Root cause | The first Rust implementation multiplied by `1.0f32 / length`, which rounds differently in the last ULP. |
| Rust change | `resources::compressed_mesh::normalize` now divides each component by the length. |
| Regression evidence | `resources::compressed_mesh::tests::normalize_matches_the_reference_runtime` plus the normals/tangents differential in `geometry_matches_the_reference_runtime`. |
| Remaining comparison | Only three normalize inputs were probed; the fix is the source's actual formula, so broader inputs follow from the same expression. |


## DIFF-VALUECONSTANT-TYPEID-001 — `ValueConstant_5_5`'s `TypeID` is inert

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Confirmed source behavior recorded; the Rust port models an explicit `type_id` and notes the constraint |
| Source location | `AssetRipper.SourceGenerated.Subclasses.ValueConstant.ValueConstant_5_5` (generated); consumed by `AssetRipper.SourceGenerated.Extensions/ClipExtensions.cs` `ConvertValueArrayToGenericBinding` |
| Input evidence | Isolated probe (`Temp/opencode/vcread`, `vcfields`, `vctype`) created `ValueConstant.Create(version)` for 4.3–2017. `ValueConstant_4` has a private `m_TypeID` field and round-trips `TypeID`; `ValueConstant_5_5` has only `m_ID`, `m_Type`, `m_Index`, its `TypeID` getter always returns 0, and setting `TypeID` or `Type` leaves it 0. |
| Source-derived behavior | `ClipExtensions.ConvertValueArrayToGenericBinding` reads `values.Data.ValueArray[i].TypeID`. On the `_5_5` layout (Unity 5.5+) that value is always 0, so every entry takes the `else` branch: an Animator binding with `Attribute = ID` and stride 1, instead of the Transform position/rotation/scale classification. |
| Root cause | The generated `_5_5` subtype dropped the `m_TypeID` serialized field (the CRC now lives in `Type`), but the extension was not updated to read `Type`. This is a baseline quirk, not a Rust defect. |
| Rust change | `resources::clip::ClipView::convert_value_array_to_generic_binding` reproduces the source algorithm over an explicit `ValueArrayEntry::type_id`. The serialization layer must mirror the generated class: for the `_5_5` layout leave `type_id` at 0 (do not substitute `Type`), so 5.5+ conversion degenerates identically. |
| Regression evidence | `resources::clip::tests::clip_matches_the_reference_runtime` asserts the four-binding result for the `_4` layout (4.3/5.0/5.4) and the empty result when a clip has no binding; the fixture is committed as `src/resources/clip_binding_fixture.txt`. |
| Remaining comparison | No real 5.5+ asset with a legacy `Binding` array has been converted through both tools, and the Unity re-import effect of the degenerated bindings has not been observed. |


## DIFF-GUID-TOSTRING-001 — `UnityGuid.ToString` nibble order

| Field | Finding |
|---|---|
| Status | Fixed in Rust and regression-covered by a reference-runtime differential |
| Source location | External `AssetRipper.Primitives.UnityGuid.ToString`; the generated `GUID` subclass override in `AssetRipper.AssemblyDumper/Passes/Pass502_FixGuidAndHashYaml.cs`; consumed by `Meta.ExportYamlDocument` (`root.Add(GuidName, GUID.ToString())`) and every project-pointer YAML GUID |
| Input evidence | Isolated probe (`Temp/opencode/guidprobe2`) constructed `UnityGuid` from word tuples and byte spans and captured `ToString`/`ToByteArray`. For `Data0=0x01020304, Data1=0x11121314, Data2=0x21222324, Data3=0x31323334` the reference yields `40302010413121114232221243332313`, the per-word reversal of the big-endian hex; `ToByteArray` round-trips the four little-endian words. |
| Source-derived behavior | `UnityGuid.ToString` emits each 32-bit word's nibbles from least significant to most significant, which is the canonical Unity layout: the well-known `unity default resources` GUID is `0000000000000000e000000000000000` for the word tuple `(0, 0, 0xE, 0)`. |
| Root cause | The Rust `format_unity_guid` read the four little-endian words but emitted each word's nibbles most-significant first, producing the reversed string (`00000000000000000000000e00000000` for the same tuple). Every `.meta` GUID and every YAML GUID reference was therefore reversed relative to the baseline. |
| Rust change | `format_unity_guid` now emits nibbles least-significant-first. Ten self-authored test expectations that encoded the reversed convention were corrected to the reference-derived values (GUID map keys, `m_Guid`/`m_Guids`, `Meta`/pointer YAML, sidecar bytes, workspace pointer GUIDs). |
| Regression evidence | `export::unity_yaml::tests::unity_guid_string_matches_the_reference_runtime` asserts the four committed probe rows (`src/export/guid_fixture.txt`) plus the canonical engine GUID; the previously failing Meta/pointer/value/workspace tests now pass unchanged in behavior. |
| Remaining comparison | The `Hash128.ToString` helper's exact byte layout is in the external package and was not probed; no Unity-import run has confirmed the exported GUIDs. |
